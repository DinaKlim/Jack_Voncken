## Magmatic ores

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Ores related to mantle degassing**

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Segregation deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└──  T-11. This is a chromite ore from the Philippines. In this sample the olivine is completely altered to serpentine.



$~~~~~~~~$├── **Deposits linked to the demixing of melts**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└──  T-4 is a typical massive sulfidic ore from Sudbury, with pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite and magnetite.

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└──  T-8 (from the Frood-Stobie mine) shows chalcopyrite, intergrown with the (in general rather rare) mineral cubanite (CuFe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>). In T-8 sometimes accessory Bi-Te minerals can be found.

$~~~~~~~~$└── **Granitic Magmas and Pegmatites**

## Hydrothermal ores

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Magmatic type** 

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Greisen Tin Deposits (related to granite)**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── An example of an ore from Panasqeira can be found in specimen T-5 from the practical collection. This is a complicated ore with many subsequent phases of mineralization. The general model is: the first mineral in the veins was cassiterite, followed by quartz, muscovite and very rare wolframite. After this, there was a sulphide rich phase, which led to the crystallization of pyrite, pyrrhotite, Fe-rich sphalerite and chalcopyrite. In a later phase, carbonate with secondary pyrite and marcasite was deposited, in which the pyrrhotite was altered. Not all pyrrhotite was altered, so it is still a prominent mineral in the polished sections. Pyrite can also be found
as "melnicovite-pyrite" or "gel-pyrite", a cryptocrystalline or amorphous form of pyrite, which is deposited in concentric layers.

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── In T-18 you will find an ore from Indonesia, which fits in this
setting. No clear veins can be recognized.

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Ag-Ni-Co-Bi arsenide ores**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── Specimen T-6 is a sample of the ores from the Cobalt region, near Sudbury, Canada, which are considered to be typical. T-6 contains no native silver and Bi, but for the rest is a beautiful example of these ores. Minerals are among others: skutterudite
((Co,Ni,Fe)As<sub>3-x</sub>), nickeline (NiAs), cobaltite (Co,Fe)AsS) and loellingite/rammelsbergite1. It can be observed that skutterudite and nickeline crystallized early, followed by cobaltite and loellingite/rammelsbergite.

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Magmatic/Groundwater**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Skarn Tungsten Deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Porphyry Copper and molybdenum Deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Mesothermal deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── [T-1](https://github.com/DinaKlim/Jack_Voncken/blob/main/Ore_microscopy_samples/T1/readme.md) is a specimen from such a mesothermal Pb-Zn from Casapalca, Peru. Minerals in the ore are galena, sphalerite, pyrite, and tennantite (Cu<sub>3</sub>(As,Sb)S<sub>3.25</sub> (or Cu<sub>12</sub>(As,Sb)<sub>4</sub>S<sub>13</sub>)

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── [T-3](https://github.com/DinaKlim/Jack_Voncken/blob/main/Ore_microscopy_samples/T3/readme.md) is a Cu-ore from Bor, Serbia. The copper ores from Bor are found in a hydrothermally altered andesite. The volcanic rocks are associated with intrusive rocks varying from diorite gabbro to granodiorite. Apparently associated to the intrusives in hydrothermally altered andesite one may find massive Cu-ore as lenses, and stockwork deposits. The massive ores (typical minerals: pyrite, bornite, enargite/luzonite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, covellite) are considered to be hydrothermal replacement ores. Porphyry copper ore is also found at Bor, in an underground mine which displays lower lying ores under the massive ores (mined
in an open pit mine).

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── The deposits of Pribram, Czechia, are mesothermal to epithermal Pb-Zn-Ag vein ores. The ores, related to the felsic magmatism of the so-called Bohemian Pluton, are of a Hercynian age. The ores have a complicated mineralogy, and are thought to have formed in multiple phases. Ore minerals are predominantly galena and sphalerite. The further away one moves from the granodiorite (exposed in a mine close to Pribram, at the deepest levels), the more one finds Ag-sulfosalts (proustite, pyrargyrite), arsenopyrite, and complex Pb-sulfosalts (e.g. jamesonite). Galena is often silver bearing. These ores are demonstrated in T-9A and T9-B. In T-9B the reaction of original galena to jamesonite is sometimes beautifully demonstrated.

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Epithermal deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── In specimen [T-2](https://github.com/DinaKlim/Jack_Voncken/blob/main/Ore_microscopy_samples/T2/readme.md), you find an example of native gold, deposited in veins with galena, sphalerite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. The ore is from Sumatra, Indonesia. Sumatra was already known in ancient times for its gold deposits. Evidence are the Sanskrit names of Swarnadwīpa ("Island of Gold") and Swarnabhūmi ("Land of Gold"), due to the gold deposits of the island's highland. Even today gold is mined on Sumatra.

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── Specimen T-13 shows an Au-Bi-ore from Tennant Creek, Australia. According to the most current theories this ore of Proterozoic age should be placed also in an epithermal setting. Volcanic activity, related to the intrusion of the Tennant Creek granite, and concurrent with folding of the sediments and ironstones in which the veins are
found, was the heat source. The hydrothermal solutions, which caused the mineralizations, may be related to granitic intrusives or volcanic activity, or they may have their origin in the dewatering of Proterozoic sediments. The possibly acid solutions leached perhaps the metals and sulfur from the sediments, and transported them to the axial zones of anticlines, which served as channels. Contact of the hydrothermal solutions with more alkali pore fluid from overlying carbonate bearing iron-rich shales resulted in the precipitation of first magnetite, and later sulphides (pyrite, chalcopyrite). Bi-sulfosalts (e.g. bismuthinite) and gold (with a high Se-content), followed as lasts minerals. Sometimes colloform textures are visible (but not very clearly), which indicates local crystallization from a gel stages. Overall temperatures were low.

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Metamorphic type**

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Seawater type**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Stratiform deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── A sample of such an ore is found in specimen T-7 from the training collection. Here you find bornite and chalcopyrite, together with tennantite, sphalerite, and renierite (Cu,Ge)<sub>3</sub>FeS<sub>4</sub>. The matrix contains quartz silicates and sometimes graphite. Carrolite can be found in just a few specimens.

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Sedimentary Exhalative (SEDEX)**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── **Mississippi Valley Type**

## Uranium ores

## Autochtonous ores

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Seawater Deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Iron ore deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── A microscope sample of Precambrian iron ore, originally deposited in seawater can be found in specimen T-19. The iron ore of T-19 is a high grade detritic iron ore. The original ore was eroded, and redeposited. This ore, from the Jack Hills in Australia comes from a region that belongs to the oldest parts of the Earth’s Crust. Age determinations on zircons from rocks in the Jack Hills gave an age of 4½ billion years (!). They are the tough remnants of ancient rocks that have long since disappeared.

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Manganese ore deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── An example can be found in T-12, where an oölitic Mn-ore from India is shown. Mn is mainly present as pyrolusite, but also as psilomelane. You will also find later formed goethite, precipitated under higher eH conditions.

Also, you find in T-12 an example of a piece of material of a manganese nodule. Manganese nodules are well known from the Pacific Ocean, where they have been often found during dredging. As there is few land surface that can serve as a source for manganese, the metal must be almost entirely originated from volcanic activity. The manganese is generally present in the form of Mn-oxides or Mn-hydroxides. The size of the nodules is 1- 30 cm, with an average of 3cm. In size, they are generally comparable to potatoes.

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Evaporites**

$~~~~~~~~$├── **Supergene deposits**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Bauxites**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$├── **Lateritic Ni-ores**

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$└── In the training collection, you can find in T-10 an example of a gossan from Zambia, in which the original minerals (magnetite, hematite) but also the weathering products (goethite & limonite) are visible. Goethite and limonite cannot readily be distinguished under the microscope.

## Allochtonous ores

## Industrial minerals
$~~~~~~~~$└── Several placer minerals can be studied in specimen T-14.

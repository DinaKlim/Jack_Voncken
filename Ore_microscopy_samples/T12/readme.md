**Sample T-12. Mn-ore, India and Mn-nodule, Pacific Ocean**

a) Mn-ore, India:

N.B.: This ore contains nodules, which are cemented by (in general) general pyrolusite..

Main minerals: 

**Pyrolusite**

Chemical composition: MnO2

Optical Category: SA

Yellowish white, 

Pleochroic, 

Elongated crystals,

Cleavage 

**Cryptomelane**

Chemical composition: KMn<sup>4+</sup><sub>6</sub>Mn<sup>2+</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>16</sub>

Bluish grey, occurs here in a **cryptocrystalline aggregate**. 

As such the anisotropy of the mineral is SA. However, a cryptocrystalline aggregate may appear to be isotropic, while the minerals in the aggregate, here cryptomelane, actually are not!

**Lithiophorite**

Chemical composition: (Al,Li)Mn<sup>4+</sup>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>
Bluish grey, pleochroic 

Optical Category: EA (interference color are black or white.)

Around open cavities, 

Relative low reflection (10 - 20 %).
May be a rather common mineral in hydrothermal lithium deposits.

**Goethite**

Bluish grey, with red/orange IR. 

Optical Category: WA â€“ DA

Rare in this specimen.

Pyrolusite. // Nicols. Coarse crystals in between nodules. Note the pleochroism and the pronounced cleavage.

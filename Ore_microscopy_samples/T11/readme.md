**T-11 - Cr-ore, Philippines**

The sample shows chromite in a serpentine matrix.

The serpentine matrix cannot be identified by using reflected light microscopy. 

The sample is from a not specified ophiolite complex in the Philippines.

**Chromite:**

Chromite is structurally strongly related to magnetite. Both belong to the spinel-group (general formula AB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). 

Spinel sensu strictu is MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, chromite is FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and magnetite is FeFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or Fe<sup>3+</sup>(Fe<sup>2+</sup>Fe<sup>3+</sup>)O<sub>4</sub>.
Other minerals in the spinelgroup are for instance: hercynite, FeAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, gahnite, ZnAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,  ulvöspinel, TiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, jacobsite, 
(Mn<sup>2+</sup>,Fe<sup>2+</sup>,Mg)(Fe<sup>3+</sup>,Mn<sup>3+</sup>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, trevorite, NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The spinelgroup is subdivided in normal and inverse spinels.

**Serpentine:**

Serpentine rock, so called because the pattern of the rock surface resembles a serpent’s skin, is actually a rock type originally formed from ultramafic rock.

Ultramafic rocks (also referred to as ultrabasic rocks, although the terms are not wholly equivalent) are igneous and meta-igneous rocks with a very low silica content (less than 45%), generally >18% MgO, high FeO, low potassium, and are composed of usually greater than 90% mafic minerals (dark colored, high magnesium and iron content). The Earth's mantle is composed of ultramafic rocks. 

**Ophiolite**

An ophiolite is a section of Earth's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed, and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks.

Notable examples of ophiolites are found in New Guinea, Newfoundland, California, and Oman. They occur also  in several places in the Phillipines (Luzon, Central Philippines and eastern Mindanao). Another well-known example is the Troödos Ophiolite in the Troödos Mountains of Cyprus.
